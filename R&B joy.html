		<center><p style="font-family: Comfortaa;" class="size"><ins>What is R&B</ins></p></center>
		<P style="font-family: Comfortaa;">R&B, which stands for Rhythm and Blues, is just that â€” music that is rhythmic and has the soulful achings of the blues. In the '90s it was easier to distinguish if a piece of music was or wasn't R&B. However, defining the genre today has become somewhat of a challenge.</P>
		<center><p style="font-family: Comfortaa;" class="size"><ins>History of R&B</ins></p></center>
		<p style="font-family: Comfortaa;">The term "rhythm and blues" appeared to replace the name "match music", and until then did it become the standard all-round phrase used in most music produced by black people at the time. After the word "race music" was considered offensive, Billboard started using the Rhythm & Blues name created by Wexler.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Comfortaa;">In the 1950s, Rhythm and Blues music was associated with black youth in nightclubs and clubs. Compared with the more expressive forms of jazz black, it was often regarded as a low-key artistic style. With the rise of hip-hop music and beginning to dominate the black social scene, R&B is considered "a bunch of love songs."</p>
		<p style="font-family: Comfortaa;">By the 1970s, the term rhythm and blues expanded into a general term encompassing soul and funk music. Today, the term can be used to roughly define most African-American urban music, although soul and funk can be placed in their own categories.</p>
