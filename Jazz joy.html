		<center><p id="type" class="size"><ins>What is Jazz</ins></p></center>

		<p id="type" class="text">Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and uses "bent" or "blue" notes. Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy.</p>

		<center><p id="type" class="size"><ins>History of Jazz</ins></p></center>

		<p id="type" class="text">Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage.</p>

		<p class="title" id=type><strong>Jazz and race</strong></p>
		<p id="type" class="text">For some African Americans, jazz music has drawn attention to the contribution of African Americans to culture and history. For others, jazz reminds people of "an oppressive and racist society and the restrictions on their artistic vision." Amiri Baraka believes that there is a "white jazz" genre that can express white people. White jazz musicians appear in the Midwest and other regions of the United States. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, is known as the "father of white jazz." The Original Dixieland Jazz Band members were white, and were the first jazz band to record a record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most outstanding jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tenacity. Others from Chicago, such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became the main members of the swing in the 1930s. Many bands include black and white musicians. These musicians helped change Americaâ€™s attitude towards race</p>

		<p class="title" id="type"><strong>Women in Jazz</strong></p>
		<p id="type" class="text">Female jazz performers and composers have contributed throughout the history of jazz. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holliday, Abby Lincoln, Anita O'day, Dinah Washington and Ethel Waugh Tes is well-known for his vocal talents, but less familiar with the band leader, composer and instrumentalist, such as pianist Lil Harding Armstrong, trumpet player Valleda Snow, songwriter Irene Higginbotan and Dorothy Fields. Women began to play jazz in the early 1920s, especially for piano.

		<p id="type" class="text">When male jazz musicians were called up during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them. Established in 1937, International Sweethearts of Rhythm is a popular band, becoming the first all-female comprehensive band in the United States and the first band to travel with USO. It toured Europe in 1945. Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson. Since the 1950s, many female jazz instrument players have been prominent, and some have long careers. Some of the most distinctive improvisers, composers, and band leaders in jazz are all women. Trombone player Melba Liston is recognized as the first female horn player to work in a major band and have a real impact on jazz. She is not only a musician, but also a respected composer and Arranger, especially through her collaboration with Randy Weston from the late 1950s into the 1990s.</p>

		<p class="title" id="type"><strong>Jews in Jazz</strong></p>
		<p id="type" class="text">Jewish Americans played an important role in jazz music. With the spread of jazz, it has developed to encompass many different cultures, and the works of Jewish composers in Tin Pan Alley have helped shape the many different sounds that jazz incorporates.</p>

		<p id="type" class="text">The reason why Jewish Americans can thrive in jazz is because they were assigned whites on probation. George Bernstein wrote that African Americans sympathized with the plight of Jewish Americans, and vice versa. As a deprived minority, Jewish composers of popular music consider themselves the natural ally of African Americans.</p>

		<p id="type" class="text">The jazz singer with Al Jolson is an example of how Jewish-Americans brought jazz and African-American music into popular culture. Benny Goodman is an important Jewish American in the development of jazz. Goodman is the leader of a racial fusion band called King of Swing. His jazz concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938 was the first time ever. Bruce Eder described this concert as "the most important jazz or pop music concert in history."</p>
