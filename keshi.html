		<p class="type">Keshi (Casey Luong) was born in Houston, Texas to Vietnamese parents and grew up in nearby Sugar Land. Although living in a diverse community with a large Asian population, he recalled that when he was growing up, he often felt out of place and disconnected from his own traditions because most of the other people around him were of Chinese descent. At the age of 13, he learned guitar from his grandfather and began to learn guitar. He started to teach himself musical instruments while using his grandfather's Vietnamese music book. Another motivation for him to learn guitar came from watching Drake Bell on the Nickelodeon TV show Drake & Josh to attract girls through his guitar skills. When he played guitar and composed music in his early years, he believed that John Meyer and Ed Sheeran had the greatest influence on him.</p>

		<p class="type">He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School in Sugar Land and received a bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an oncology nurse at Texas Medical Center for two years.</p>

		<p class="type">The name "Kesh" originated from the childhood name his girlfriend gave him. They have been friends since the fifth/sixth grade, and he goes to her house almost every day. When he went, her parents called him "Keshi" until now.</p>
