		<p class="type">Casey Luong (born November 4, 1994), known mononymously by his stage name keshi, he is an American singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his distant falsetto vocals and textural instrumentals, he has accumulated over 800 million streams with songs such as like i need u, 2 Soon and right here.</p>

		<center><p id="family" class="size"><ins><strong>Early life</strong></ins></p></center>

		<p class="type">Keshi (Casey Luong) was born in Houston, Texas to Vietnamese parents and grew up in nearby Sugar Land. Although living in a diverse community with a large Asian population, he recalled that when he was growing up, he often felt out of place and disconnected from his own traditions because most of the other people around him were of Chinese descent. At the age of 13, he learned guitar from his grandfather and began to learn guitar. He started to teach himself musical instruments while using his grandfather's Vietnamese music book. Another motivation for him to learn guitar came from watching Drake Bell on the Nickelodeon TV show Drake & Josh to attract girls through his guitar skills. When he played guitar and composed music in his early years, he believed that John Meyer and Ed Sheeran had the greatest influence on him.</p>

		<p class="type">He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School in Sugar Land and received a bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an oncology nurse at Texas Medical Center for two years.</p>

		<p class="type">The name "Kesh" originated from the childhood name his girlfriend gave him. They have been friends since the fifth/sixth grade, and he goes to her house almost every day. When he went, her parents called him "Keshi" until now.</p>

		<center><p id="family" class="size"><ins><strong>Career</strong></ins></p></center>
		<p class="type">During college, he created his moniker "Keshi", and began to share music via his SoundCloud page. He credited watching YouTube tutorials for teaching himself writing, producing, performing and engineering his music. Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical direction, but slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy vocals combined with lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention and popularity. In 2017, he quit his job as a nurse and flew to New York City to sign with Island Records. His decision to quit nursing and the pursuit of music was ultimately made due to his realization that the fear of missed opportunities exceeded his fear of failure. From there, his first singles attracted millions of listeners upon release.</p>
